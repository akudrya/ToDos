# AIS project plan - Sasha's part

The goals for my participation in AIS:

- Help to finalize AIS product specification from customer and market point of view
- Make a prototype of API for accessing AIS data

----------------------

## Week 1 01/19 - 01/25

- [x] Meet ground station designing team in Moscow.
- [x] Read online to get an initial understanding of AIS technology and protocol.
- [x] Find one-two users of AIS systems to learn about their experience.

## Week 2 01/25 - 02/02

- [x] Calculate number and location of receiving stations using online globe (EarthBrowser or Google Earth).
- [ ] Interview users of AIS: what kind of data do they use/submit, limitations, problems in system and interface and potential obstacles.
- [ ] Find and interview potential users of a small AIS receivers to learn about their needs and problems to solve. Learn about usage conditions, power supply and internet connection. (iSailor)
- [x] Research from online sources about Exact Earth and Marinetraffic products, partnerships, users.
- [ ] Plan potential products using s-AIS (B2B, B2b, B2C)

## Week 3 02/03 - 02/10

- [ ] Make a draft of UHF ground system limitations and requirements. 
- [x] Meet with Dauria Team
- [x] Make a draft oа empty API on JavaScript
- [x] Research AIS data samples
- [x] Find solutions for storing and accessing data via API
- [x] Plan mechanism of data storage, access, security for all perspective ways of providing API. 

## Week 4 02/11 - 02/18

- [ ] Make an API demonstraion: prepare dataset, requests, pdf
- [ ] Research integration of satellite imagery and AIS data
- [ ] Make a demonstration of applications of AIS data + S.I. data in API: illigal fishing, oil spills, pirates, ...
