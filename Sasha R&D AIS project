# Sasha R&D AIS project

##Projects

These are the way that I classified the work early on in oue conversation. Based on recent conversations and your research feel free to modify the projects.

1. AIS market assessment
 - project description, goals, and deliverables

2. Demo API using static data
 - project description, goals, and deliverables

3. Dynamic API
 - project description, goals, and deliverables

4. Prototype imagery and AIS solutions
 - project description, goals, and deliverables

##Deliverables

### Week 1 (February 16-20):

- Demo API
  - Create simple back end API on PHP to handle conditional requests like coordinates, name and MMSI filtering so we can ...
  - Design sample requests to demonstrate APIвЂ™s work for selected types of products. So that youвЂ™ll have text strings to be launched in web browser to demonstrate what data will be provided in JSON container.
- Market research 
  - Pdf explaining what products can be launched from the API for small to big players. Here IвЂ™ll give examples of data to be delivered, pricing framework, how data access going to be organized. (by Monday)
- Demo application
  - Developed feature: display vesselвЂ™s track on a map and find all satellite images taken there for that period of time. This is an integration with satellite imagery catalog.


### Week 2 (February 23-27):

- Imagery prototype
  - Plan how to integrate AIS + satellite imagery data: I will implement matching vessels' coordinates and label satellite images with AIS data. I expect to have an issue with time synchronization. At least IвЂ™ll show approximately what vessels are on the photographed area. This is an integration with images themselves.  
  - Implement an access to satellite images.
  - AIS + satellite imagery use cases. IвЂ™ll make both slides and an online map using Mapbox where by clicking on a certain point a user can see a satellite image labeled with AIS data and with highlighted signs of sought-for types of activities. At first it will be a static picture for each use case.


### Week 3 (March 2-6):

- Imagery prototype
  - Integrate more complex logic of showing data in Mapbox UI. Currently I've only labeled but all points from a sample dataset, filtered repeated dots and added representation of vesselвЂ™s direction.
- Demo API implementation + reporting
  - Launch AWS virtual machine (currently I use my own web hosting Bluehost).
  - Migrate all the data+API back-end
  - a  report what I've done, next steps, problems and opportunities.
  - API documentation. 
  - Plan of further development
  
 ### Week 4 (March 9-13):
 - Imagery prototype - Demo API for AIS+Satellite imagery product. 
  - product specification: use cases, modes of work design
  - back-end
  - front-end
  - tested demo requests
  - documentation
  - report

 ### Week 5 (March 16-20):
- Dynamic API
 - product specification: use cases, modes of work design
 - research of how to integrate API with data received from the satellite 

 ### Week 5 (March 23-27):
- Dynamic API
  - front-end
  - back-end
  - tested demo requests
 
 ### Week 6 (March 30 - April 3):
  - beta tests
  - making edits, corrections
  - documentation
  - report 
  - final presentation of the first iteration
